The study used Twitter to analyze complaints about Philippine telecom companies. Biterm Topic Model (BTM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were compared for effectiveness. 345,667 tweets from 2022 were sampled to 83,592. BTM outperformed LDA in coherent topics and peak complaint periods were identified. Conclusions: (1) BTM excels in complaint analysis, (2) Address various complaints, (3) Note temporal peaks. BTM is recommended for modeling, focusing on network issues and service responsiveness. Further research should explore multi-year trends.
